"""
Netprobify dynamic inventory module adding endpoints for a given service to the list of netprobify targets.
Handles IPv4 and IPv6 targets

Configuration file schema:
* namespace: Namespace of the service to watch
* service_name: Name of the service to watch
* dst_port: Target port for created ports. Defaults to 80
* target_options: Additional options to set on the Netprobify probe - any thing you can set on a target object of the netprobify config is acceptable
  Required keys:
  * groups: must be set to an array of netprobify group names to add discovered targets to
